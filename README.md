# Image-Convolution-from-Scratch
A Python-based computer vision project demonstrating manual implementation of convolution on grayscale and RGB images using NumPy, along with comparisons to OpenCV’s built-in filtering functions. The project explores common image processing kernels such as edge detection, smoothing, and sharpening.
